As a way to practice implementing some of the theory and techniques we've been learning about over the last three weeks, I'm planning to work on a small project to give an opportunity to do so without risking any real JD assets. As part of this I'd like to extend an open invitation to any others who'd like to join in and work on a team, and encourage others to do their own projects as well.

For the project I had in mind, I was wanting to make a simple revision webapp for the courses we've been doing. You'd have users with accounts that stores their saved quizzes and high scores on each, and then a database of quiz questions for each quiz. It would repeatedly ask quiz questions about a topic until the user runs out of lives, and for each correctly answered question the user gets points (bonus for answering quickly). An important part of this to me is looking at project mangement and how git fits into it, so hopefully it'd be a chance for all of us to learn about different skills whilst also learn about working in a team. If you're interested, feel free to drop me a message.
