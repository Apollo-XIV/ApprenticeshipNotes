# Industry Tools
Project management is not a new problem, and as such, many tools have been created to tackle this. For our group project, I lobbied for us to use GitHub Projects, as it provided a familiar and unintimidating environment for a group of new developers. 

Many other services are available, such as Jira and Asana. Whilst these are great products, they're better suited to much larger team sizes, and also come with a built in cost and ecosystem that could've been limiting for our scale.

<!-- These are my notes -->

# Organisational Structure
Efficient use of time and resources in the project necessitates a form of organisational structure to help facilitate the delegation of tasks, review of work, and a cohesive direction for the project.

For ours we had Kenan act as our Project Leader, with me helping to write and assign tasks in Github Issues.

# Using Milestones
Milestones are a feature in github Issues which allows you to group individual issues together. We used this to track the individual tasks in the project, allowing us to have a good top level view of the project as a whole.

# GitHub Issues
An issue is an individual task within a project. We divided tasks down into these smaller goals so that it was easier to analyze and decide what must be done next. This is following the principle of Abstraction and Decomposition in computational thinking.

# Meeting Format
**1. Agenda & Minutes**
	For each minute we took minutes and made an agenda before each one. This meant we could stay focused and on task for the entire meeting, making sure we use our time efficiently.
	
**2. Roundtable discussions**
	To make sure everyone has a say and is involved in the conversation, we went around the "room" and made sure everyone got to have some input.

# Project Roadmap

 *The roadmap feature on Github provides a great way to visualise and understand upcoming deadlines and the states of multiple individual tasks.*
