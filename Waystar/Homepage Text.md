# Features
### 40m+ Books
With access to over 40 million books and the entire Google Books repository, chances are that we have exactly what you're looking for. Add as many books as you'd like to your account, with the option to group them into categories for convenience.

### A Feed You Can Care About
Catch up on exciting moments from your latest book or see what your friends have been reading in one place. Every reader is different, but, with a personalised timeline, Waystar makes it easy to engage with the communities you care about.

### Leave Virtual Footnotes
Waystar lets you track books using logs. A log is simply a collection of posts, made by you, that keeps note of where in the book you are using page numbers. Each post has a page number attached, meaning posts are only shown to either those who've opted in to spoilers or won't be affected by them. Use posts to write your thoughts on a passage, predictions for what happens next, or simply to add your own personal notes to the book - for those shy of annotating books directly.
