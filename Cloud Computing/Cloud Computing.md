# On-Demand Self-Service
This allows consumers to provision services on an as-needed basis, without the need to contact the CSP directly. These resources might include additional compute power, additional storage, new websites or even database services. The consumer is abel to expand or reduce these services without the need for human assistance from the CSP.
# Broad Network Access
Client devices and traditional server deploments are able to access cloud-based resources across the network. The network might include the local on-premise networok or the Internet or Both. Cloud-Resources have the potential to be globally accessible.
# Resource Pooling
Cloud service providers pool network, storage, and compute capabilities, and then dynamically and automatically allocate those resouces to consumers on an on-demand basis. The consumers do not know (or care) where the resources are physically located. The next time those services are used by teh consumer the resource locations might have changed. The CSP manages the resources and maximises their use.
# Rapid Elasticity
Server Resources in a traditional model are purchased as a capital expenditure, and whether or not these resources are efficiently utilized, their cost and capabilities are fixed. In some business models, resource needs change throughout the year. For example, retail demand is significantly higher during some parts of the year than others. With loud-based computing, resources are dynamically allocated, making for far more efficient utilization of those resources. Servers that might hae been underutilized for most of the year no longer need to be purchased and maintained.
# Measured Service
CSPs meter the utilization of their resources. This metering permits more efficient and dynamic resource allocation. It also permits the CSPs to bill consumers accurately for exactly the amount of resources consumed.
