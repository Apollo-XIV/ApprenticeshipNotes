Cloud services, no matter the style, are well suited to support security, governance, and compliance. Set templates allow you to ensure that all deployed resources meet corporate standards and abide by government regulatory requirements. Plus, it is easier to update all deployed resources in one go as standards and regulations change. Depending on the operating model, software patches and updates can also be applied automatically, which helps ensure security and mitigating risk.

Security varies widely between different cloud models, as best described in the [[Shared-Responsibility Model]]. IaaS solutions provide almost complete control over your security, whereas PaaS or SaaS models may take care of more aspects of security but leave you with much less customisability if you have specialist business needs.

In general, due to all hardware and network connectivity being on the CSP's end, they are far more prepared to deal with DDoS attacks and other such exploits, so because of this cloud security can sometimes be easier than managing an on-prem service.
