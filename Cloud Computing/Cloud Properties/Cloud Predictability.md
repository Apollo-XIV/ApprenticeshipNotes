Reliability and Predictability are two incredibly important factors when developing cloud solutions.
# Reliability
Reliability is defined as the ability of a system to recover from failures and continue to function. The cloud, by virtue of being decentralised, enables you to have resources deployed in regions around the world so that if one datacenter fails, another one can pick up the load. It is possible to design applications to automatically take advantage of increased reliability, and have services automatically migrate to another datacenter.

# Predictability
Predictability is how confident you can be in crucial services and devices. Much like availability, predictability is how much knowledge you have of these events before they happen. 
## Performance
Performance predictability focuses on predicting the resources needed to deliver a positive experience for your customers. [[Autoscaling]], [[Load Balancing]], and [[Cloud Availability#High Availability|high availability]] are just some of the cloud concepts that support performance predictability.
## Cost 
Cost predicatbility is focuses on predicting the cost of the cloud spend. This is important to ensure your business doesnt incur any unexpected expenses. With cloud monitoring solutions you can ensure that you're using your resources in the most efficient way and apply data analytics to better predict when you'll need more services or resources. This also allows you to better predict costs, and tools like TCO calculators (total cost of ownership) and pricing calculators allow you to get an estimate of a potential cloud spend.
