Cloud technology affords a high degree of manageability and metering, as observed in [[Cloud Predictability#Cost|its predictability]]. There are two types of manageability for cloud computing:

# Management of the cloud
This describes managing your cloud resources themselves. With the cloud you can:
- Automatically [[Cloud Availability#Scalability|scale]] resource deployment based on need.
- Deploy resources based on a preconfigured template, removing the need for manual configuration.
- Monitor the health of resources and automatically [[Cloud Predictability#Reliability|replace failing resources]].
- Receive automatic alerts based on configured metrics, so you're aware of performance in real time.

# Management in the cloud
This describes how you can manage the individual resources themselves. With the cloud you can:
- Through a web portal.
- Through a CLI.
- Using APIs.
- Using PowerShell.
