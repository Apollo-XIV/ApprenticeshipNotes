## Storage as a Service (STaaS)
STaaS is a cloud subscription that gives users access to a file management service. STaaS takes many forms, from consumer grade services like google Drive and OneDrive, to Enterprise/Cloud facing services like S3 buckets or [[Azure Storage#Storage Services|Azure Blobs]]

## Communications
These services all look at fulfilling an organization's communication needs, such as Google Workspace, Microsoft Teams, Slack, or Zoom.

There are also cloud based services, such as SMTP services, SMS, and more.

## Collaboration
this software allows for synchronous work on projects or documents, like shared word documents, slideshows, file sharing, and more. This software greatly enables a modern distributed workforce as teams are no longer reliant upon a local file share server that you would access from an intranet.

## Virtual Desktop Infrastructure
Similarly to Desktop as a Service, VDI provide remote access to workstation-class VMs. Apps and programs run on servers in datacenters rather than local machines, with computers in an organisation being replaced with Thin Clients instead.

## Directory and Identity Services
Directory and Identity services enable single sign on, multifactor authentication, and other services and functions to an organisation. [[Azure Active Directory]] allows user and device management for example, as well as controlling user permissions.
