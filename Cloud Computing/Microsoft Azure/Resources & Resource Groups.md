# Resources & Resource Groups
A resource is a single deployed element in Azure. A resource group is simply a way of grouping and categorising these resources. Resources may only belong to a single resource group, however, a resource group may have many child resources. Moreover, resource groups cannot be nested. Resource groups allow you to apply actions to all children in the group easily. If you delete a resource group, all its children will be killed, for example. Resource groups are not governed or managed in any way by Microsoft, so it is completely up to the user to decide what configuration best suits their needs.
