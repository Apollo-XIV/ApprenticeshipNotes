[[Microsoft Azure]] as a service offers a range of availabilities in the 99% range, which at the low end can be up to 7.2 hours per week. At the high end, Azure can offer 99.99% which is just 10 minutes per week. However, these high uptimes come at a premium, and therefore must only be used for the most critical services. Moreover, a cloud SLA only provisions against their faults and errors, and makes no accounting for errors in your own cloud services or deployments; you are still liable for your own faults and mistakes.
