The Shared-Responsibility model describes the balance of onus on parties in a cloud service engagement. In a typical 'on-prem' model, the company or owner of the systems would be entirely responsible for their operation, upkeep, and more. However, when using a cloud provider, a degree of responsibility shifts to the provider, as things such as site security stop making as much sense for the user to be responsible for.

# Drawing the Line
The decision of 'where to draw the line' is heavily dependant upon what type of service is being provided by the cloud provider. There are three primary groups that significantly alter how much is handled by the provider:

## [[IaaS]] (Infrastucture as a Service)
Infrastructure as a Service, by virtue of giving the end user the most control, also absolves the provider of the most responsibility.

## [[PaaS]] (Platform as a Service)
Platform as a Service operates as a form of middle-ground between IaaS and SaaS and as such it's responsibility balance follows suit.

## [[SaaS]] (Software as a Service)
Software as a Service has the most of all the options handled by the provider as the service provided is generally complete as is.

## [[XaaS]] (Anything as a Service)
Anything as a Service describes any technology solution that has moved to the cloud. They can be anywhere in the Shared-Responsibility Model.
