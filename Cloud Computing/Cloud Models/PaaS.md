Platform as a Service is the middle ground between [[IaaS]] and [[SaaS]]. In PaaS you rent all that you do in IaaS but the CSP also handles the OS, middleware, development tools, and business intelligence services that makes up a cloud solution. With PaaS all patching and licensing is handled by the CSP.

The [[Shared-Responsibility Model]] also applies to PaaS. In PaaS you all the same responsibilities are given to the CSP as in the IaaS model. Along with IaaS' responsibilities the CSP also governs the OS and potentially network controls, applications, and identity and directory infrastructure.

PaaS may be seen in the two following example scenarios:
- **Development**: PaaS provides a framework that developers can build upon to develop or customise cloud-based applications. Similar to the way you create an excel macro, PaaS lets developers create applications using built in software components. Cloud features such as scalability, high-availability, and multi-tenant capability are included, reducing the amount of coding that developers must do.
- **Analytics:** Tools provided as a service with PaaS allow organizations to analyze and mine their data, finding insights and patterns and predicting outcomes to improve forecasting, product design decisions, investment returns, and other business decisions.

# Azure Virtual Desktop
[[1. Intro to Microsoft Azure]] Virtual Desktop is Microsoft's own PaaS solution, allowing access to a virtualised Windows PC from anywhere at any time (provided you have a network connection of course). Leaving the local device without any local storage has certain security advantages, and the OS is fully integrated with Azure AD.
