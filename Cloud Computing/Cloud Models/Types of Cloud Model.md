Cloud services can be quite easily divided into four main categories:
# Private
This describes a system in where the cloud is only accessible to a given group of people or those with authorisation. All other access is restricted.
# Public
A public model makes use of a general purpose data-center that anyone can use, including private companies. These resources are often managed by providers like AWS and Azure and offer good support.
# Hybrid
Hybrid describes a cloud computing model that makes use of both a public and a private cloud. This may appeal to organisations particularly as it gives them many of the benefits of a public cloud while still maintaining the privacy and customisability of a private cloud.

| Public                                                                | Private                                                            | Hybrid                                                            |

| No Capital Expenditures to Scale Up                                   | Organisations have complete control over resources and security    | Provides the most flexibility                                     |
| Applications can be quickly provisioned and deprovisioned             | Data is not collocated with other organisations' data              | Organisations determine where to run their applications           |
| Organisations pay only for what they use                              | Hardware must be purchased for startup and maintenance             | Organisations control security, compliance, or legal requirements |
| Organisations don't have complete control over resources and security | Organisations are responsible for hardware maintenance and updates |                                                                   |

# Community Cloud
Access to the cloud is not exclusive however is restricted to those of a certain group or business network. 

# Multi-Cloud
Some organisations may find themselves using multiple cloud providers at the same time, either in order to access specific features from each provider or as part of a transitionary period.

# Azure Arc
Azure Arc is a Microsoft product  designed to help manage a cloud environment. It does so for multiple platforms of any format, inlcuding multi-cloud and with other providers.
