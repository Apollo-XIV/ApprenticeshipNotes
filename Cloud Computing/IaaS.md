Infrastructure as a Service provides the greatest amount of flexibility in cloud service management. In an IaaS model the CSP only provides the physical hardware and connectivity to the VM, and all on-board services and software are completely managed by the end user. In IaaS you are essentially renting only the hardware in the datacenter and nothing else.

As described in the [[Shared-Responsibility Model]], IaaS leaves the user with the greatest amount of responsibility, with the CSP only being responsible for the physical hosts, the network, and the datacenter.

Examples of where IaaS may be in place are as follows:
- **Lift and Shift Migration:** You're standing up cloud resources similar to your on-prem datacenter, and hten simply moving ht esthings running on-prem to running on the IaaS infrastructure.
- **Testing and Development**: You have established configurations for development and test environments that you need to rapidly replicate. You can stand up or shut down the different environments rapidly with IaaS structure, while maintaining complete control.
