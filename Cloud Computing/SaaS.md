Software as a Service provides the most complete cloud environment from a product perspective. As opposed to [[PaaS]] or [[IaaS]], you're essentially renting a fully furnished application. All sorts of services, such as email, financing, messaging, and more are hosted in the cloud. SaaS is the least flexible, however, also the easiest to get operating.

As always, SaaS operates as part of the [[Shared-Responsibility Model]], with CSPs being responsible for most things in the service. The only things the end user is responsible for are the ingoing information and data, the devices used to access it, accounts and identities on the service, and perhaps the identity and directory infrastructure (depending on the organisation).
