# Software Defined Networking
Software Defined Networking is the process of controlling and defining network rules using software. For example, switches in a network may pull their rules from a server instead of being programmed directly. This removes the need for a network engineer to setup routers and switches individually. In a typical switch or router, there's a data plane and a control plane. With software defined networking there is only a data plane.
