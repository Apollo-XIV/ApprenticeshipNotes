Load balancing is the process of distributing work between a group of servers. This is especially important if employing horizontal scaling techniques, as otherwise the new deployments won't be able to make any difference. The load balancer's job is to act as an entry point to the service for the user, who then directs the user's request to a server with capacity to handle it. A load balancer should automatically monitor the status of the servers in its work pool, and if one stops operating or is at capacity it should stop sending jobs to it.
